## Cloning

This project includes [rxi/classic](https://github.com/rxi/classic) library as a submodule. So, in order to properly clone, you will have to use the flag `--recurse-submodules`

    git clone --recurse-submodules git@github.com:rthurmed/minefield.git

You can also get the submodules afterwards by running the following commands in the cloned repository

    git submodule init
    git submodule update
